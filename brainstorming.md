# Brainstorming

Just going to leave some ideas here about some of the different slides we could have, feel free to add your own.

#### General Stats Slide
This slide will just have some generic stats from the season, such as:
- Total Points
- Average points per week
- Favourite formation
- Top scoring players
- Best Week
- Worst Week
- And more...

#### Which Prem Manager are you?
This slide will compare your stats to some famous premier league managers. 

- Pep Guardiola - Started on-top, stayed on top. Dominated the league.
- Alex Ferguson - Clutched up late in the season to win the league
- Sam Allerdyce - Stayed off the bottom after a rough start to the year.
- Sean Dyche - Lots of English players and loves the 4-4-2
- Jose Mou - Wins the cup after an average league season.  

#### Transfer Policy

This slide will go into detail about how you used your transfers through the year.

- Set it and forget it - Made team at the start of the year and did not change much
- Mr Moneybags - Made loads of transfers, and spent a lot of money.
- Mr Worldwide - Used players from a large variety of countries. 
- Buy low - Your squad value was regularly above 100M. Had a knack for buying players before they good too pricey.

#### X-Factor

This is the trait that sets you apart from other managers in your league. Where did you have the edge over your competition?

- Used your chips well (scored more using chips than others in your league)
- Picked your captain well (highest scorer is usually captained)
- Used transfers well (players you transfer in score more than who you sell)
- Picked team well (big points scorers were usually on the pitch)
- Good recruitment (had some less commonly picked players who scored very well)
